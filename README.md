# House-Price-Prediction

This project uses regression models to predict housing prices in Iowa. 

### The Problem
The problem is to build a model that will predict house prices with a high degree of predictive accuracy given the available data. More about it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).\
“With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.”

### The dataset
The dataset is the prices and features of residential houses sold from 2006 to 2010 in Ames, Iowa. Obtained from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data).

### Data Description
Here is a data [description file](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data). (data_description.txt)
